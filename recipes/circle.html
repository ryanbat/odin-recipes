      A donut, also called doughnut, is a kind of fried dough confectionery. Donuts are typically ring shaped with a hole in the middle. Bakers also make oval shaped donuts, which are often filled with custards or fruit preserves.
      Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, but other types of
      batters can also be used. Various toppings
      and flavorings are used for different types, such as sugar, chocolate or
      maple glazing.
